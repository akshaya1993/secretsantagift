**Key Components in the Diagram:**
Jenkins

Acts as the orchestrator of the CI/CD pipeline.
Triggers the pipeline steps such as build, testing, and deployment.
Apache Maven

Used for building the application.
Handles dependency management and compiles the source code into deployable artifacts (like JAR or WAR files).
SonarQube

Performs static code analysis.
Ensures code quality by checking for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.
Dependency Check

Analyzes the project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Ensures that third-party libraries used in the project are secure.
Docker

Builds a Docker image of the application, encapsulating it along with all dependencies into a container.
Trivy

A vulnerability scanner for Docker images.
Scans the built Docker image to detect any security flaws or misconfigurations.
Docker Container

Runs the packaged application inside a Docker container.
Ensures the application is portable and works consistently across environments.
Application

Represents the final deployed application, which can now be accessed by end-users.


**Pipeline Flow:**
Code Build (Jenkins → Maven)
Jenkins initiates the build process using Maven. The application source code is compiled, and the necessary dependencies are resolved.

Code Analysis (Jenkins → SonarQube & Dependency Check)

SonarQube evaluates the quality of the codebase.
Dependency Check identifies any vulnerabilities in the libraries used.
Containerization (Jenkins → Docker)
The built application is packaged into a Docker image.

Security Scanning (Docker → Trivy)
The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities by Trivy to ensure security before deployment.

Deployment (Trivy → Docker Container)
The verified Docker image is run as a container, which represents the deployed application.

Final Deployment (Docker Container → Application)
The containerized application is hosted and made accessible to end-users.
